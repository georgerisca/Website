	<h2>Iași Skatepark:</h2>
	<p>
Fundatia Comunitara Iasi in partnership with Lidl had provided 58000 euros to re-vitalize the skatepark in Iasi, Romania. This was carried out in the form of a contest (with 6000 euros prize money), where participants submitted their design for a new skatepark to be built. The winning team was then appointed to carry out the organization and building of the new park.
<br><br>
I worked with Lorena Baraniuc on this project. Our goal was to make a new concrete skate park for the community in Iasi to enjoy regardless of skill level. We managed to do so in our plans while remaining way under the budget and also using concrete ramps which would ensure the park lasts for many years to come.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, we didn’t win the contest. Although, after the winning team received their prize money, they decided to drop out from the project and left Fundatia Comunitara to carry out designing, documentation, and building on their own. At this point, Fundatia Comunitara reached out to me in order to offer expertise and carry out redesigning the skatepark as there were many problems with the size and flow of the ramps in the winning design. There were already building permits in effect with the old design, so my re-design is a bit of a compromise between the winning park and my own.
<br><br>
I didn’t receive any credit for my participation and my name isn’t written anywhere, although the silver lining is that I got to see my designs posted by the mayors office and on the local news, and to see a skatepark built that was influenced by my work. What you see here includes my initial submission, new designs, and pictures of the final skatepark.
